# To-Do-App-Take-4
 Let's hope the forth time is the charm :)

 My To-Do App was created to be a user friendly app and something that was easy to use. 

 Starting off with the color choices: I decided on the pink, grey and darker grey colors because it's soft on the eye and in some way makes you feel good about doing the To-Do's. 

The meaning of the color pink: "pink is the color most often associated with charm, politeness, sensitivity, tenderness, sweetness, childhood, femininity, and romance." - wikipedia.

Grey is also less intense and looks much more gentle than black.

I couldn't find an image I liked so I tried my hand at Figma, I put a layer on top of the image and changed the opacity of the layer so that the picture has a shade. This causes the header to stand out more and complement each other. 

I chose blossoms because it resembles a new season and a new beginning. 

The first section takes in the user input's for the task and the date, this is where the user can create the task and add it to the list. e.g. Go to the gym - 2022/08/18.

The second section displays all the todo-items, this allows the user to see what they need to do, what has been done, and also has three actions which allows the user to either edit the todo, or delete the todo. 

The third action is the checkbox, when clicked the list will have a strikethrough the todo-item which indicates that the task has been done. After that is can be deleted, or the checkbox can be undone and go back to the first state it was in. 

At the bottom of the app is the sort alphabetically button which will sort the list in an alphabetical order when clicked. 

This app was created by Chanique Lombard.
